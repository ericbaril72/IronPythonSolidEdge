# What next ?
Not having a SolidEdge WebKey access, I can't get in touch with the SE community.
Maybe this way, Some of You might contact me Here and we can share usefull stuff.

I currently connect with any ASM / PSM or PAR, 
Extract the BOM of an ASM -> Push it into our ERP system
Batch  Validate tons of ASM and their PSM/PAR
Batch Validate the associated DFT, and report on those requiring updates

SUPER COOL : I dispatch Validation Jobs accross multiple stations to maximize our licenses use

All control is Webserver Based ...  only IronPython is required to be installed
